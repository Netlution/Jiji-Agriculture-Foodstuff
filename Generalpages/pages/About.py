This project was developed as part of a broader initiative to **analyze agricultural market trends using data-driven techniques**.  
Our focus is on providing **valuable insights** into the online marketplace by examining pricing patterns, market distribution, and anomalies that could affect both **buyers and sellers**.  

We specialize in **web data extraction, cleaning, and analysis**, turning unstructured online information into actionable intelligence. By applying these methods to the Agriculture and Foodstuff category on [Jiji.ng](https://jiji.ng/agriculture-and-foodstuff), we offer a clearer understanding of how agricultural products are priced and distributed across different regions in Nigeria.

## Why This Analysis Matters  

### üìä Importance of the Analysis  
- **Market Insights** ‚Üí Identifies pricing trends and demand variations across products.

- **Risk Detection** ‚Üí Highlights outliers that may indicate unrealistic listings, fraud risks, or premium pricing.  
- **Decision-Making Support** ‚Üí Provides a knowledge base for farmers, traders, policymakers, and businesses.  

### üåê Why Scrape Jiji.ng?  
Jiji.ng is one of Nigeria‚Äôs largest online marketplaces, widely used for buying and selling agricultural products.  
Scraping its data allows us to:  
- Collect **real-time, large-scale market information** not readily available elsewhere.  
- Understand the **economic value chain** of agricultural products online.  
- Build datasets that can guide **business strategy, economic research, and policy-making**.
